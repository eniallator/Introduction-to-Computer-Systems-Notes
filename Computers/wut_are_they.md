# Notes

- What are they?

## Lets Play Whats A Computer

### Abacus

- Is it a computer?
- Not a computer since it's entirely manual

### Antikythera Mechanism

- Firstly wtf is this LOL
  - Star stuff
  - Tells you what things in the solar system do
- Computes, but isn't a computer
- Only 1 specific use, not general

### Mechanical Trumpet

- Looks like a hooman
- Not a computer at all, idek why it was even on this slideshow

### Babbage Engines

#### Difference Engine

- Mechanical
- Computes mathematical tables
- What it does is fixed, can't compute anything general

#### Analytical Engine

- Could've been a computer if it existed
- Was digital
- Representing numbers in decimal
- Could follow a procedure

### Pocket Computer

- Basic ones aren't rly computers
- Advanced ones _**ARE**_ computers

### Digi-Comp I

- Mechanical device
  - Has rods and actuators
- Pull a rod and it will do stuff `( Í¡Â° ÍœÊ– Í¡Â°)`, has a 3 number output
- Can be programmed

### Colossus

- Uses paper tape
- The tape goes at 5m/s (basically fast as fuck boiiiii)
- Was used for decrypting messages

### Zuse Z-Series

- German made
- Mechanical
- Could run a program
- Could perform an arbitrary calculation

### ENIAC

- A computer

### Manchester Baby

- Had a working memory
- Claimed to be the first modern computer

### Summit

- 2.3 mill CPU cores
- 2.8 PB of memory
- 9.8 megawatts of power
- Â£20k+ per day to run
- All because someone wanted to use chrome <sub><sub>... jk ðŸ˜‚</sub></sub>

## What Is A Computer Then

- Informally:
  - A computer is a device that processes something by executing a set of instructions
- Formally:
  - Something something turning machine can compute anything
  - For a device to be called a general purpose computer, it must be equivalent to a turing machine
  - If a device can execute a program with conditional branching and the ability to change arbitrary memory locations, it's a general purpose computer
  - TURING COMPLETE ðŸ˜€

## Storing Information In Bits

- A bit is a measure of information, and also a unit for the amount of information that can be represented digitally
- One bit (short for "binary digit") represents the elementary states in a binary system, i.e 0 or 1
- tl;dr bits == data storage == binary things
- The amount that can be stored in `n` binary digits is `2^n`

### Binary

- I mean this is binary, so if you don't know it and you're taking this module ur fked

### Abacus Combinations

- Bottom has 5 beads
  - 6 different states
- Top has 2 beads
  - 3 different states
- The amount of states for `n` rods is: `(6*3)^n`
  - 13 rods: 20,822,964,865,671,168 (AKA nearly 21 quadrillion)
- Use log<sub>2</sub> to figure out how many bits are needed to store a figure
  - Need 55 bits for previous number
